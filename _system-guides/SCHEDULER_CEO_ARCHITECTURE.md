# Scheduler CEO Architecture Guide 🏢

Welcome to the Timelapser v4 organizational chart! This guide explains our system architecture using a friendly corporate analogy. Think of the Scheduler as the CEO who makes ALL timing decisions, with specialized departments handling the actual work.

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

> **"The Scheduler says 'jump' and pipelines say 'how high'"**

The SchedulerWorker is our CEO - the single authority for ALL timed operations. No department makes timing decisions independently; everything flows through the CEO's office.

## 🏢 Corporate Structure

### 👥 HR Department - Models Layer
**Role**: Employee Standards & Company Policies  
**Mission**: Define what makes a valid employee and enforce company standards

**Responsibilities**:
- **Employee Records**: Define structure for all entity types (Camera, Timelapse, Image, etc.)
- **Job Descriptions**: Pydantic models specify exact requirements for all data
- **Company Policies**: Validation rules and constraints for all operations  
- **Standardization**: Ensure consistent data formats across all departments
- **Onboarding**: Proper structure and validation for new data entry

**Example**:
```python
class CameraModel(BaseModel):
    """HR defines what makes a valid Camera employee"""
    name: str = Field(..., min_length=1, max_length=100)
    rtsp_url: str = Field(..., regex=r"^rtsp://.*")
    status: CameraStatus
    # HR ensures all cameras follow company standards
```

### 🤝 Account Managers - Router Layer  
**Role**: Client Relations & Request Routing  
**Mission**: Handle all external client interactions and route requests appropriately

**Responsibilities**:
- **Client Interface**: Handle all API requests from frontend and external clients
- **Request Translation**: Convert client needs into internal work orders
- **Department Routing**: Direct requests to appropriate departments via CEO
- **Status Updates**: Provide real-time feedback to clients
- **Authentication**: Validate client permissions and access rights

**Example Client Interactions**:
```python
# Client: "I want to add a new camera"
@router.post("/cameras")
async def create_camera(camera_data: CameraCreate):
    # Account Manager validates with HR standards
    # Routes request through CEO to Camera Department
    # Returns status to client
```

### 👔 CEO Office - SchedulerWorker
**Role**: Central Authority & Timing Coordinator
- **Decision Making**: ALL timing decisions flow through here
- **Job Scheduling**: Uses APScheduler for immediate and scheduled operations
- **Department Coordination**: Delegates work to appropriate departments
- **Performance**: Single point of control eliminates timing conflicts

### 📸 Capture Department
**Department Head**: CaptureWorker  
**Mission**: Image acquisition and quality assurance

**Teams**:
- **RTSP Team**: Camera connectivity and image capture
- **Corruption Team**: Quality analysis and flagging
- **Quality Management**: Scoring and validation

**Workflow**:
1. CEO schedules capture job
2. Department Head coordinates team activities
3. RTSP Team captures image
4. Corruption Team analyzes quality
5. Quality Management validates results

### 🎬 Video Department  
**Department Head**: VideoWorker  
**Mission**: Video generation and automation

**Teams**:
- **FFmpeg Team**: Video encoding and processing
- **Overlay Integration**: Text and graphics overlay
- **File Management**: Output organization and storage

**Workflow**:
1. CEO triggers video generation (immediate or scheduled)
2. Department Head manages the video pipeline
3. Teams coordinate to produce final video
4. File Management handles storage and metadata

### 🖼️ Media Department
**Department Head**: ThumbnailJobManager  
**Mission**: Image processing and thumbnail generation

**Teams**:
- **Thumbnail Workers**: Image resizing and optimization
- **Overlay Workers**: Text and metadata overlay processing

**Workflow**:
1. CEO schedules thumbnail generation
2. Department Head queues and prioritizes jobs
3. Workers process images efficiently
4. Results integrated back to system

**IMPORTANT - Background Processing Workers**:
Some workers in this department have autonomous `run()` methods:
- **ThumbnailWorker.run()**: Continuously processes thumbnail job queues
- **OverlayWorker.run()**: Continuously processes overlay job queues
- **CleanupWorker.run()**: Runs scheduled maintenance operations

These `run()` methods are **LEGITIMATE** and follow CEO architecture:
- They do NOT make timing decisions (that's the CEO's job)
- They process work queues created by the CEO
- They handle background tasks without blocking main operations
- They respect the scheduler's timing authority completely

## 🔄 Communication Flow

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Scheduled vs Non-Scheduled Operations

**Operations That Require CEO Scheduling:**
- Image captures (timing-based)
- Video generation (immediate or scheduled) 
- Health monitoring (recurring)
- Weather updates (recurring)
- Thumbnail processing (queued work)

**Operations That Don't Require CEO Scheduling:**
- Adding/editing cameras (database CRUD)
- Updating settings (configuration changes)
- Viewing data (read operations)
- File operations (immediate I/O)
- User authentication (immediate validation)

### Corrected Camera Creation Flow ✅
```
1. API Client: "I want to add a camera and start capturing"
    ↓
2. Account Manager (Router): "Let me validate this request with HR"
    ↓
3. HR (Models): "✅ Request format is valid, here's the structured data"
    ↓
4. Account Manager → Camera Dept: "Add this camera to database"
    ↓
5. Camera Dept: "✅ Camera added successfully"
    ↓
6. Account Manager → CEO: "New camera needs capture scheduling"
    ↓
7. CEO (Scheduler): "Got it! Scheduling captures every 5 minutes"
    ↓
8. CEO → Camera Dept: "Start capture job for new camera"
    ↓
9. Account Manager → Client: "✅ Camera created and capturing every 5 minutes"
```

### Direct CEO Model (Our Choice ✅)
```
CEO: "Generate video for timelapse 123 immediately"
    ↓
Video Dept Head: "Yes sir! Starting now"
    ↓
Video teams execute → Report completion to CEO
```

### Why Not Operations Manager? ❌
```
CEO: "Generate video for timelapse 123"
    ↓
Operations Manager: "Let me coordinate that..."
    ↓
Video Dept: "Working on it..."
    ↓
Operations Manager: "CEO, it's done"
```
*Too many middlemen = slower communication*

### Real-World Examples

#### Adding a Camera (Split Operation)
```
CRUD Part (No CEO):
Client Request → Account Manager (camera_routers.py) → 
HR Validation (CameraModel) → Camera Department → Database Insert

SCHEDULING Part (CEO Required):
Account Manager → CEO (SchedulerWorker) → 
Schedule capture jobs → Ongoing captures
```

#### Changing Settings (May/May Not Need CEO)
```
Simple Setting Change (No CEO):
Client Request → Account Manager (settings_routers.py) →
HR Validation (SettingsModel) → Update configuration → Response

Timing-Related Setting (CEO Required):
Account Manager → CEO (may reschedule affected jobs) →
Update schedules → Response to client
```

#### Manual Video Generation (CEO Required - Timing Operation)
```
Client Request → Account Manager (video_routers.py) →
HR Validation (VideoJobModel) → CEO (immediate job scheduling) →
Video Department → Generate video → Response to client
```

#### Viewing Camera List (No CEO - Read Operation)
```
Client Request → Account Manager (camera_routers.py) →
Camera Department → Fetch from database → Response to client
```

## 📋 Job Types & Timing

### Immediate Jobs (run_date=now)
- **Per-capture video generation**: "Make video RIGHT NOW"
- **Corruption retry operations**: "Re-analyze this image immediately"
- **Manual user requests**: "User clicked button, do it now"

### Scheduled Jobs (recurring)
- **Image captures**: "Every 5 minutes, capture from camera X"
- **Daily video generation**: "Every day at 6pm, make daily video"
- **Health monitoring**: "Every minute, check camera status"
- **Weather updates**: "Every hour, refresh weather data"

### Event-Driven Jobs (triggered by conditions)
- **Milestone videos**: "After 100 images, make milestone video"
- **Quality threshold alerts**: "If corruption >90%, alert immediately"

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### Layer-Specific Responsibilities

#### HR Department (Models)
```python
class CameraModel(BaseModel):
    """HR policy: What makes a valid camera"""
    name: str = Field(..., min_length=1)
    rtsp_url: str = Field(..., regex=r"^rtsp://.*")
    status: CameraStatus
    
    class Config:
        # HR enforces these standards company-wide
        validate_assignment = True
        use_enum_values = True
```

#### Account Manager (Router)
```python
@router.post("/cameras")
async def create_camera(camera_data: CameraCreate):
    """Account Manager handles client camera creation request"""
    
    # 1. Validate with HR standards (automatic via Pydantic)
    # 2. Route to CEO for timing coordination  
    # 3. Return professional response to client
    
    result = await camera_service.create_camera(camera_data)
    return ResponseFormatter.success("Camera created successfully", result)
```

#### Department Head Responsibilities
Each department head coordinates their team but **never makes timing decisions**:

```python
class CaptureWorker(BaseWorker):
    """Department Head for Capture Operations"""
    
    async def execute_capture(self, timelapse_id: int):
        # CEO called us - execute immediately
        # Coordinate RTSP, corruption, and quality teams
        pass

class VideoWorker(BaseWorker):
    """Department Head for Video Operations"""
    
    async def process_video_generation(self, job_id: int):
        # CEO scheduled this job - process it
        # Coordinate FFmpeg, overlay, and file teams
        pass
```

### CEO Scheduling Examples
```python
# CEO schedules immediate work
scheduler.add_job(
    func=capture_worker.execute_capture,
    trigger="date",
    run_date=datetime.now(),  # RIGHT NOW
    args=[timelapse_id]
)

# CEO schedules recurring work  
scheduler.add_job(
    func=video_worker.process_daily_video,
    trigger="cron",
    hour=18, minute=0,  # 6 PM every day
    args=[timelapse_id]
)
```

## 🎉 Why This Complete Corporate Structure Works

### 🏢 Professional Organization
1. **HR Standards**: Consistent data validation across all operations
2. **Client Relations**: Professional interface through Account Managers
3. **Clear Command Structure**: CEO coordinates all timing decisions
4. **Specialized Departments**: Each team focuses on their expertise
5. **Efficient Delegation**: Proper channels eliminate confusion

### ⚡ Technical Benefits
1. **No Timing Conflicts**: Single source of truth for all schedules
2. **Data Consistency**: HR enforces standards everywhere
3. **Clean APIs**: Account Managers provide professional endpoints
4. **Easy Debugging**: Clear ownership at every level
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Each layer can grow independently

### 🔄 Request Flow Efficiency

**For Non-Scheduling Operations (Direct):**
```
API Request → Account Manager → HR Validation → 
Department Execution → Client Response
```

**For Scheduling Operations (CEO Involved):**
```
API Request → Account Manager → HR Validation → CEO Coordination → 
Department Execution → Status Updates → Client Response
```

Each step has a clear purpose and owner, eliminating bottlenecks and confusion. The CEO only gets involved when timing coordination is actually needed.

## 🔄 Worker run() Methods - Architectural Clarification

### ✅ LEGITIMATE Background Processing Workers

Some workers implement `run()` methods for autonomous background processing. These are **NOT architectural violations** but essential components of the CEO pattern:

#### ThumbnailWorker.run()
```python
async def run(self) -> None:
    """Continuously processes thumbnail generation job queues"""
    while self.running:
        await self.process_jobs()  # Process queued jobs created by CEO
        await asyncio.sleep(self.interval)
```

#### OverlayWorker.run()  
```python
async def run(self) -> None:
    """Continuously processes overlay generation job queues"""
    while self.running:
        await self.process_jobs()  # Process queued jobs created by CEO
        await asyncio.sleep(self.interval)
```

#### CleanupWorker.run()
```python
async def run(self) -> None:
    """Runs scheduled maintenance operations"""
    while self.running:
        await self._run_cleanup_cycle()  # Clean up old data
        await asyncio.sleep(self.cleanup_interval_hours * 3600)
```

### 🎯 Why These run() Methods Are Legitimate

1. **No Timing Decisions**: They don't decide WHEN to do work - they process existing queues
2. **CEO Creates Work**: The SchedulerWorker creates jobs, these workers just process them
3. **Performance Critical**: Background processing prevents blocking main capture workflow
4. **Queue Pattern**: Classic producer (CEO) / consumer (background workers) architecture
5. **Respectful**: They never override or conflict with scheduler timing

### ❌ What Would Be Architectural Violations

```python
# ❌ BAD - Worker making timing decisions
class BadWorker:
    async def run(self):
        if self.should_capture_now():  # ← VIOLATION: timing decision
            await self.capture_image()

# ❌ BAD - Worker scheduling its own jobs  
class AnotherBadWorker:
    async def run(self):
        scheduler.add_job(...)  # ← VIOLATION: scheduling authority
```

### 🏢 Corporate Analogy

Think of background workers as **night shift janitors**:
- CEO schedules "clean conference room A" (creates job in queue)
- Night shift janitor checks the queue and does the work
- Janitor doesn't decide WHEN to clean - just processes the work orders
- This keeps the building running without interrupting daytime operations

## 🚀 Result

A complete corporate structure where:
- **HR (Models)** ensures all data follows company standards
- **Account Managers (Routers)** provide professional client service  
- **CEO (SchedulerWorker)** coordinates all timing decisions
- **Department Heads (Workers)** execute specialized operations
- **Background Workers** process job queues autonomously without timing authority
- **Teams (Services)** focus on their core competencies

The scheduler truly says "jump" and all pipelines say "how high!" while maintaining professional standards and client relations throughout the entire organization. Background workers with `run()` methods are essential departments that keep the company running efficiently without challenging the CEO's authority.
