# Domain Responsibilities

This document defines clear ownership boundaries for the Timelapser v4 application following domain-driven design principles.

## üèóÔ∏è Core Philosophy

**"Owner controls child lifecycle, child controls own properties"**

- Camera spawns timelapses but doesn't control their internal settings
- Timelapse spawns images/videos but doesn't control their individual operations
- Each entity is responsible for its own domain and the lifecycle of its children

## üìä Domain Hierarchy

```
Camera (God Entity)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Owns Timelapse Lifecycle
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Camera Properties & Operations  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Latest Image Access

Timelapse (Domain Owner)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Owns Image/Video Generation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ All Timing & Scheduling Settings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Video Generation Settings
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Bulk Operations

Image (Self-Contained)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Individual Operations

Video (Self-Contained) 
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Individual Operations
```

  - Enable/disable camera
  - Health monitoring & connectivity tests
  - Manual capture triggers

- **Latest Image Access**

## üîÑ Implementation Strategy

### **Phase 1: Frontend Component Boundaries (Week 1)**
1. **Camera Card Cleanup**
   - Remove video generation from camera cards
   - Keep only: camera settings + timelapse lifecycle
   - Remove bulk operations

2. **Create Timelapse Detail Views**
   - Full timelapse management interface
   - Video generation controls
   - Bulk image/video operations
   - Timing & scheduling settings

3. **Component Hook Separation**
   - `useCameraOperations` - camera domain only
   - `useTimelapseOperations` - timelapse domain only
   - `useImageOperations` - individual image operations
   - `useVideoOperations` - individual video operations

### **Phase 2: API Endpoint Cleanup (Week 2)**
1. **Add Missing Timelapse Lifecycle Endpoints**
   - `POST /timelapses/{id}/pause` - pause any timelapse
   - `POST /timelapses/{id}/resume` - resume any timelapse  
   - `POST /timelapses/{id}/stop` - stop any timelapse

2. **Remove Duplicate Endpoints**
   - Remove deprecated timelapse lifecycle endpoints
   - Consolidate similar functionality

### **Phase 3: Model Migration (Week 3)**
1. **Move Timing Settings**
   - Add time window fields to timelapse model
   - Migrate timing logic from camera to timelapse
   - Remove timing fields from camera model
   - Database migration

2. **Update Service Layer**
   - Align service methods with domain boundaries
   - Update business logic to match ownership model

### **Phase 4: Validation & Cleanup (Week 4)**
1. **Test Domain Boundaries**
   - Verify each component only calls its domain endpoints
   - Test timelapse lifecycle across all states
   - Validate bulk operations work correctly

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize API calls for new component structure
   - Update SSE events to match domain boundaries
   - Clean up unused code

## üéØ Benefits of This Structure

- Each component knows exactly what it owns
- No more mixed responsibilities in camera cards
- Easier to reason about and test

### **Better User Experience**
- Dedicated timelapse management interface
- Logical grouping of related operations
- Consistent interaction patterns

### **Maintainable Code**
- Domain-specific hooks and services
- Easier to add new features within domains
- Clear separation of concerns

### **Scalable Architecture**
- Easy to extend each domain independently
- Clear API patterns for new features
- Reduced coupling between components

## üö® Key Rules

1. **Camera cards ONLY handle camera domain + timelapse lifecycle**
2. **Video generation ALWAYS happens in timelapse context**
3. **Bulk operations ALWAYS happen in timelapse context**
4. **Individual operations happen in their own domain context**
5. **No component calls endpoints outside its domain**
6. **Latest image access stays with camera (as requested)**
7. **Any timelapse can be resumed, not just active one**
