# Scheduler-Centric Architecture Transformation

**Project**: Timelapser v4 Architecture Refactor  
**Goal**: Transform to centralized scheduling where SchedulerWorker is the single authority for ALL timing decisions  
**Status**: Phase 1 - Foundation & Pipeline Restructuring  
**Started**: 2025-01-18

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This document provides the complete technical specification for transforming Timelapser v4 from a dual-scheduling architecture to a centralized scheduler-centric model. The SchedulerWorker will become the single authority for all timing decisions, while we simultaneously restructure the scattered thumbnail and overlay systems to follow the well-organized corruption pipeline model.

### Key Objectives:
1. **Centralized Timing Authority**: All timing operations flow through SchedulerWorker
2. **Pipeline Standardization**: Restructure thumbnails/overlays to follow corruption model
3. **Code Cleanup**: Eliminate duplicate and scattered files
4. **Cross-Functional Integration**: Maintain logging, health, SSE throughout transformation

---

## 📋 Architecture Philosophy & Rules

### Core Philosophy
> **"The scheduler says 'jump' and pipelines say 'how high'"**

The SchedulerWorker becomes the central timing authority that coordinates all operations, while specialized workers become execution-only "department heads" that perform work when scheduled.

### Rules of Engagement

#### 1. **Scheduler Authority Rule**
- ALL timing decisions must flow through SchedulerWorker
- No service may make autonomous timing decisions
- Use APScheduler for both immediate (`run_date=now`) and scheduled operations

#### 2. **Test-First Rule**  
- Every phase must pass tests before proceeding
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Rollback capability must be preserved

#### 3. **Clean-As-You-Go Rule**
- Delete old/duplicate files immediately after replacement works
- No orphaned code or files
- Update imports and references immediately

#### 4. **Pipeline Consistency Rule**
- Follow corruption pipeline structure as the organizational model
- Consistent naming patterns across all pipelines
- Clear separation: pipeline coordinator → services → utilities

#### 5. **Cross-Functional Integration Rule**
- SSE events for all scheduled operations
- Health monitoring for scheduler performance
- Logging for all timing decisions
- Statistics tracking for coordination effectiveness

## 🗂️ Current State Analysis

### Current Architecture Problems

#### Problem 1: Dual Scheduling Systems
```
✅ SchedulerWorker: Handles timelapse captures
❌ VideoWorker: Independent video automation  
❌ Manual Triggers: Bypass scheduler entirely
❌ Thumbnail/Overlay: Direct worker calls
```

#### Problem 2: Scattered Thumbnail System
```
❌ CURRENT MESS:
backend/app/services/
├── thumbnail_job_manager.py (TOP LEVEL)
└── thumbnail_pipeline/
    ├── thumbnail_job_manager.py (DUPLICATE!)
    ├── thumbnail_job_service.py
    ├── thumbnail_service.py
    ├── thumbnail_performance_service.py
    ├── thumbnail_verification_service.py
    └── orphaned_file_repair_service.py
```

#### Problem 3: Scattered Overlay System  
```
❌ CURRENT MESS:

├── overlay_service.py (TOP LEVEL)
├── overlay_pipeline/ (EMPTY!)
├── capture_pipeline/overlay_bridge_service.py
└── video_pipeline/overlay_integration_service.py
```

#### Problem 4: Inconsistent Patterns
The corruption pipeline is well-organized, but thumbnails/overlays don't follow the same pattern.

### Phase 2: Scheduler Enhancement ⏳

**Objective**: Extend SchedulerWorker to handle all timing operations

#### 2.1 SchedulerWorker Extensions

**File**: `backend/app/workers/scheduler_worker.py`

**New Methods to Add**:
```python
def schedule_immediate_video_generation(
    self, 
    timelapse_id: int, 
    trigger_type: str, 
    priority: str = "high",
    settings: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
) -> str:
    """Schedule immediate video generation using APScheduler"""
    
def schedule_immediate_thumbnail_generation(
    self, 
    image_id: int, 
    priority: str = "medium"
) -> str:
    """Schedule immediate thumbnail generation using APScheduler"""
    
def schedule_immediate_overlay_generation(
    self, 
    image_id: int, 
    overlay_settings: Dict[str, Any],
    priority: str = "medium"
) -> str:
    """Schedule immediate overlay generation using APScheduler"""
    
def schedule_bulk_thumbnail_generation(
    self, 
    image_ids: List[int], 
    priority: str = "low"
) -> List[str]:
    """Schedule bulk thumbnail generation using APScheduler"""
    
def reschedule_timelapse_captures(
    self, 
    timelapse_id: int, 
    new_interval_seconds: int
) -> bool:
    """Reschedule existing timelapse capture job with new interval"""
    
def cancel_all_jobs_for_timelapse(
    self, 
    timelapse_id: int
) -> int:
    """Cancel all scheduled jobs for a specific timelapse"""

    """Get comprehensive status of all scheduled jobs"""
    
def get_job_queue_statistics(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Get detailed statistics about job queues and performance"""
```

#### 2.2 SchedulerService Interface

**New File**: `backend/app/services/scheduler_service.py`

**Purpose**: Async wrapper for SchedulerWorker to be used by services and routers

```python
class SchedulerService:
    """
    Async interface to SchedulerWorker for timing coordination.
    
    Provides async methods that services and routers can use to request
    scheduling operations from the central SchedulerWorker.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, scheduler_worker: SchedulerWorker):
        self.scheduler_worker = scheduler_worker
    
    async def schedule_immediate_video_generation(
        self, 
        timelapse_id: int, 
        trigger_type: str, 
        priority: str = "high",
        settings: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
    ) -> str:
        """Request immediate video generation scheduling"""
        
    async def schedule_immediate_thumbnail_generation(
        self, 
        image_id: int, 
        priority: str = "medium"
    ) -> str:
        """Request immediate thumbnail generation scheduling"""
        
    async def schedule_immediate_overlay_generation(
        self, 
        image_id: int, 
        overlay_settings: Dict[str, Any],
        priority: str = "medium"
    ) -> str:
        """Request immediate overlay generation scheduling"""
        
    async def get_job_status(self, job_id: str) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Get status of a specific scheduled job"""
        
    async def get_queue_statistics(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Get current queue statistics"""
```

#### 2.3 Dependency Injection Updates

**File**: `backend/app/dependencies.py`

**Add**:
```python
from .services.scheduler_service import SchedulerService

def get_scheduler_service() -> SchedulerService:
    """Get scheduler service instance"""
    # Implementation will depend on how we access the scheduler worker
    pass

SchedulerServiceDep = Annotated[SchedulerService, Depends(get_scheduler_service)]
```

### Phase 3: Service Layer Transformation ⏳

**Objective**: Update services to route timing operations through scheduler

#### 3.1 JobCoordinationService Updates

**File**: `backend/app/services/capture_pipeline/job_coordination_service.py`

**Critical Method Changes**:
```python
# BEFORE (bypasses scheduler):
def coordinate_video_job(self, timelapse_id: int, trigger_type: str, priority: str = JOB_PRIORITY.MEDIUM):
    """Coordinate video job creation and processing."""
    try:
        # Direct video pipeline call - BYPASSES SCHEDULER!
        job_id = self.video_ops.create_video_job(
            timelapse_id=timelapse_id,
            trigger_type=trigger_type,
            priority=priority
        )
        return {"success": True, "job_id": job_id}
    except Exception as e:
        return {"success": False, "error": str(e)}

# AFTER (requests from scheduler):
def coordinate_video_job(self, timelapse_id: int, trigger_type: str, priority: str = JOB_PRIORITY.MEDIUM):
    """Coordinate video job creation through central scheduler."""
    try:
        # Request scheduling from central authority
        job_id = self.scheduler_service.schedule_immediate_video_generation(
            timelapse_id=timelapse_id,
            trigger_type=trigger_type,
            priority=priority
        )
        return {"success": True, "job_id": job_id}
    except Exception as e:
        return {"success": False, "error": str(e)}
```

**Similar Updates for**:
- `coordinate_thumbnail_job()`
- `coordinate_overlay_job()`
- Any other timing-related coordination methods

#### 3.2 VideoWorkflowService Transformation

**File**: `backend/app/services/video_pipeline/video_workflow_service.py`

**Remove Autonomous Processing**:
```python
# REMOVE these autonomous methods:
def process_next_job(self) -> Optional[int]:
    """Process the next pending video job in the queue."""
    # This bypasses scheduler - REMOVE!
    
def process_automation_cycle(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Process video automation triggers."""
    # This makes timing decisions - REMOVE!
```

**Keep Execution Methods**:
```python
# KEEP these execution methods (called by VideoWorker when scheduled):
def execute_video_generation(self, job_id: int, timelapse_id: int, settings: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
    """Execute specific video generation job (called by scheduler)."""
    
def execute_bulk_video_generation(self, job_ids: List[int]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Execute multiple video generation jobs (called by scheduler)."""
```

#### 3.3 Pipeline Integration Updates

**Thumbnail Pipeline Integration**:
- Update capture pipeline to use new thumbnail pipeline structure
- Route thumbnail requests through scheduler service
- Maintain existing thumbnail generation quality

**Overlay Pipeline Integration**:  
- Update capture and video pipelines to use new overlay pipeline structure
- Route overlay requests through scheduler service
- Maintain existing overlay functionality

### Phase 4: Router Layer Updates ⏳

**Objective**: Update routers to route timing operations through scheduler

#### 4.1 Video Automation Router Updates

**File**: `backend/app/routers/video_automation_routers.py`

**Critical Change in Manual Generation Endpoint**:
```python
@router.post("/video-automation/generate/manual")
async def trigger_manual_generation(
    request: ManualGenerationRequest,
    scheduler_service: SchedulerServiceDep,  # NEW DEPENDENCY
    timelapse_service: TimelapseServiceDep,
    db: AsyncDatabaseDep,
):
    """Manually trigger video generation for a timelapse"""
    
    # Validate timelapse exists (unchanged)
    timelapse = await validate_entity_exists(
        timelapse_service.get_timelapse_by_id, request.timelapse_id, "timelapse"
    )

    try:
        # BEFORE (bypasses scheduler):
        job_id = await run_sync_service_method(
            video_pipeline.queue.add_job,  # Direct department call!
            request.timelapse_id,
            VIDEO_AUTOMATION_MODE.MANUAL,
            request.priority or JOB_PRIORITY.HIGH,
            request.settings,
        )

        # AFTER (requests from scheduler):
        job_id = await scheduler_service.schedule_immediate_video_generation(
            timelapse_id=request.timelapse_id,
            trigger_type=VIDEO_AUTOMATION_MODE.MANUAL,
            priority=request.priority or JOB_PRIORITY.HIGH,
            settings=request.settings,
        )
        
        # SSE event creation (unchanged)
        # Response formatting (unchanged)
```

#### 4.2 Other Router Updates

**Camera Routers**: Update for thumbnail scheduling  
**Timelapse Routers**: Update for capture rescheduling  
**Settings Routers**: May need scheduler coordination for timing-related settings

**Important**: Maintain direct routing for CRUD operations (non-timing operations)

### Phase 5: Worker Coordination ⏳

**Objective**: Transform workers to execution-only model

#### 5.1 VideoWorker Transformation

**File**: `backend/app/workers/video_worker.py`

**Remove Autonomous Processing**:
```python
# REMOVE autonomous video automation processing:
async def process_video_automation(self) -> None:
    """Process video automation triggers."""
    # This makes timing decisions independently - REMOVE!
```

**Add Execution Methods**:
```python
# ADD execution methods (called by SchedulerWorker):
async def execute_video_generation(self, job_id: int, timelapse_id: int, trigger_type: str, settings: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
    """Execute specific video generation job when scheduled by SchedulerWorker."""
    
async def execute_bulk_video_generation(self, job_ids: List[int]) -> None:
    """Execute multiple video generation jobs when scheduled by SchedulerWorker."""
```

#### 5.2 ThumbnailWorker & OverlayWorker Updates

**Similar Transformations**:
- Remove autonomous job polling
