# Settings Save Performance & Accuracy Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **False Change Detection** 
- **Problem**: Settings page showed all settings as updated even when no changes were made
- **Root Cause**: Weather settings were always being saved regardless of actual changes
- **Fix**: Added proper change detection for weather settings (lines 198-206)

### 2. **Unnecessary API Refresh**
- **Problem**: `fetchSettings()` called after every save, even when no changes made
- **Root Cause**: Unconditional call to refresh settings after save operation
- **Fix**: Only call `fetchSettings()` when `changedSettings.length > 0` (lines 447-450)

### 3. **Multiple Individual API Calls**
- **Problem**: Settings save made 11+ individual PUT requests for each setting
- **Root Cause**: Loop making individual API calls for each setting change
- **Fix**: Implemented bulk update using `/api/settings/bulk` endpoint (lines 275-289)

### 4. **Expensive Corruption Settings Comparison**
- **Problem**: Complex API fetch and comparison logic for corruption settings
- **Root Cause**: Frontend doing change detection instead of backend
- **Fix**: Simplified to always send corruption settings, let backend handle optimization (lines 312-314)

## Performance Improvements

- **Before**: 11+ individual API calls + 1 corruption fetch + 1 weather fetch + 1 settings refresh
- **After**: 1 bulk API call + 1 corruption call + conditional weather calls + conditional refresh

## Files Modified

- `/src/app/settings/hooks/use-settings.ts`: Main optimization logic
- Weather settings: Only save changed values
- Core settings: Use bulk update endpoint  
- Corruption settings: Simplified change detection
- Settings refresh: Only when changes actually made

## Expected Results

1. Toast messages now correctly show only changed settings
2. Save operation completes much faster (fewer API calls)
3. No unnecessary network requests when no changes made
4. Improved user experience with accurate feedback
