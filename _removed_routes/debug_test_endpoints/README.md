# Removed Debug and Test Endpoints

## Removed Routes (2025-01-01)

The following debug and test endpoints were removed as development artifacts:

### `/api/debug/images` (GET)
- **Reason**: Development artifact - calls non-existent backend `/api/images/debug`
- **Status**: Broken (backend endpoint doesn't exist)
- **File**: `debug_images_route.ts`

### `/api/tests` (GET, POST)
- **Reason**: Development artifact - security risk for web-exposed test execution
- **Status**: Already disabled for security reasons
- **File**: `tests_route.ts`

## Impact

- **Security**: Removed potential security risks from web-exposed test execution
- **API Surface Area**: Cleaned up broken debug endpoints
- **Maintainability**: Eliminated non-functional development artifacts
- **Production Readiness**: Removed endpoints not intended for production use

## Alternative Approaches

- **Debug Information**: Use proper logging and monitoring systems
- **Test Execution**: Run tests manually via CLI: `cd python-worker && ./run-tests.sh`
- **Development Debugging**: Use browser developer tools and backend logs

*These endpoints were removed as part of systematic API cleanup to achieve production-ready API surface area.*
