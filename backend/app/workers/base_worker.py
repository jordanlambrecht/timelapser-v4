"""
Base worker class for Timelapser v4 worker architecture.

Provides common interfaces and utilities for all worker types.

IMPORTANT ARCHITECTURAL NOTE:
This base class provides TWO distinct lifecycle methods:

1. start()/stop() - Worker lifecycle management
   - Called by worker.py to initialize/cleanup workers
   - Sets self.running flag and calls initialize()/cleanup()
   - DOES NOT start autonomous processing loops

2. run() - Optional autonomous background processing (NOT DEFINED HERE)
   - Implemented by workers that need continuous background processing
   - Examples: ThumbnailWorker, OverlayWorker, CleanupWorker
   - These run() methods are LEGITIMATE and follow the CEO architecture
   - They process job queues or run scheduled tasks autonomously
   - They do NOT make timing decisions (that's the SchedulerWorker's job)

CEO ARCHITECTURE COMPLIANCE:
- SchedulerWorker = CEO (makes all timing decisions)
- Background Workers with run() = Departments processing job queues
- Direct Workers (CaptureWorker) = Immediate delegates with no autonomous timing

Workers with run() methods are NOT architectural violations - they are
essential background processors that handle work queues independently
while respecting the scheduler's timing authority.
