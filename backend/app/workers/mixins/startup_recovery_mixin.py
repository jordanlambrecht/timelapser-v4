StartupRecoveryMixin for standardized stuck job recovery.

Eliminates repetitive startup recovery patterns across job processing workers
while maintaining consistent logging and error handling.

This mixin provides:
- Standard stuck job recovery pattern
- Consistent recovery result logging
- Proper error handling during recovery
- Configurable recovery parameters
