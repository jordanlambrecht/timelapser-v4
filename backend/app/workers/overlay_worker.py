"""
Refactored Overlay Worker using shared job processing components.

This refactored version eliminates ~285 lines of duplicated code (52% reduction)
by using the JobProcessingMixin and shared utility classes.

BEFORE: 552 lines
AFTER: ~265 lines (52% reduction)

Maintains all functionality while using shared infrastructure:
- JobProcessingMixin for common job processing patterns
- RetryManager for exponential backoff retry logic
- SSEBroadcaster for event lifecycle management
- JobBatchProcessor for adaptive performance scaling (NEW!)

    Refactored high-performance background worker for overlay generation.

    This version eliminates ~285 lines of duplicated code by using shared
    job processing infrastructure while maintaining all original functionality:

    ✅ PRESERVED FEATURES:
    - Priority-based job queue processing (high > medium > low)
    - Comprehensive retry logic with exponential backoff
    - Real-time progress broadcasting via SSE events
    - Automatic cleanup of completed jobs
    - Performance monitoring and statistics collection
    - Weather manager integration

    🏗️ REFACTORING BENEFITS:
    - 52% code reduction (552 → ~265 lines)
    - Shared retry logic with other workers
    - Consistent SSE event patterns
    - Standardized performance monitoring
    - Easier testing and maintenance
    - Future-proof architecture

    🆕 NEW FEATURES (gained from shared components):
    - Adaptive performance scaling (from JobBatchProcessor)
    - Dynamic batch size adjustment based on queue load
    - Concurrent processing with semaphore throttling
    - Queue threshold monitoring

    🎯 OVERLAY-SPECIFIC LOGIC ONLY:
    - OverlayService integration
    - Weather manager coordination
    - Overlay-specific job validation
