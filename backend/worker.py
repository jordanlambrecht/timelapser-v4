Timelapser Async Worker with Modular Architecture

This module implements an asynchronous timelapse worker using a modular architecture:

Core Functionality:
- Orchestrates specialized worker classes for different responsibilities
- Maintains the same external interface as the monolithic version
- Provides improved maintainability and testability

Worker Architecture (CEO Pattern):
- SchedulerWorker: CEO - Makes ALL timing decisions and coordinates work
- CaptureWorker: Direct delegate - Executes captures when instructed by scheduler
- HealthWorker: Direct delegate - Performs health checks when called
- WeatherWorker: Direct delegate - Refreshes weather data when called
- VideoWorker: Direct delegate - Processes video jobs when called
- ThumbnailWorker: Background processor - Autonomously processes thumbnail job queues
- OverlayWorker: Background processor - Autonomously processes overlay job queues
- CleanupWorker: Maintenance processor - Runs scheduled cleanup operations

IMPORTANT ARCHITECTURAL CLARIFICATION:
Some workers have run() methods for autonomous background processing:
- ThumbnailWorker.run() - Processes thumbnail generation job queues continuously
- OverlayWorker.run() - Processes overlay generation job queues continuously
- CleanupWorker.run() - Runs scheduled maintenance operations

These run() methods are LEGITIMATE and follow CEO architecture:
- They do NOT make timing decisions (scheduler's job)
- They process work queues created by the scheduler
- They handle background tasks that don't need scheduler coordination
- This pattern prevents blocking the main capture workflow

The CEO pattern is maintained:
- Scheduler = Timing authority and work coordinator
- Background Workers = Job queue processors (timing-independent)
- Direct Workers = Immediate execution delegates

The modular design allows for:
1. Independent testing of each worker type
2. Easier maintenance and debugging
3. Future scalability and microservice migration
4. Better separation of concerns

This implementation maintains full backward compatibility with the original
monolithic worker while providing a foundation for future architectural evolution.
